# Why I Built tane· - An AI Startup Validator

Building a startup is hard. Validating an idea shouldn't be.

## The Problem

Every developer has that friend with "the next big idea." But how do you actually validate if it's worth pursuing?

## Introducing tane· (種)

**tane** means "seed" in Japanese - it's the beginning of something that could grow.

### How It Works

1. **Market Research**: Analyzes existing solutions
2. **Competitor Analysis**: Finds direct and indirect competitors  

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit
- **AI**: Pi Agent + SearXNG
- **Backend**: Bun + SQLite with better-sqlite3


## Key Learnings

### 1. AI Agents Need Clear Prompts

The biggest challenge was getting consistent outputs. Every prompt needed explicit structure.

### 2. Local-First Data

Users don't trust cloud storage for their startup ideas. Everything stays local.

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

Don't overwhelm users with options. Start simple, reveal complexity over time.
